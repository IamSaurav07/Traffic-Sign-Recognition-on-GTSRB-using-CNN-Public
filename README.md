# Traffic-Sign-Recognition-on-GTSRB-using-CNN-Public

– Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model using Preprocessing Pipeline for image classification model which
adopts the LeNet architecture.
– Done advanced image processing techniques, including RGB to grayscale conversion, histogram equalization, and normalization.
– Discovered that using a larger dataset and fine-tuning a pre-trained CNN model can significantly enhance traffic sign classification performance.
– Developed a traffic sign classification system using the GTSRB Dataset(which it includes 43 classes and more than 50000
images. ), achieving an accuracy of 99.77%. The system effectively classified various traffic signs in real-world scenarios
